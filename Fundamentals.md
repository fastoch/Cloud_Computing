# What is cloud computing?

The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (**NIST**) created this term in 2011:

Cloud computing is a way of using information technology (IT) that has these five equally important traits:
- customers get computing resources that are on-demand and self-service (storage, processing power, and network)
- customers get access to those resources over the internet, from anywhere (through a web interface)
- the provider of those resources has a large pool of them, and allocates them to users out of that pool
- the resources are elastic, which means they can increase or decrease as needed, so customers can be flexible
- customers pay only for what they use (if they stop using resources, they stop paying)
