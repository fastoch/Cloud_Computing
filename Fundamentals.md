# What is cloud computing?

The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (**NIST**) created this term in 2011:  
https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/145/final  

Cloud computing is a way of using information technology (IT) that has these 5 equally important traits:
- customers get computing resources that are on-demand and self-service (storage, processing power, and network)
- customers get access to those resources over the internet, from anywhere (through a web interface)
- the provider of those resources has a large pool of them, and allocates them to users out of that pool
- the resources are elastic, which means they can increase or decrease as needed, so customers can be flexible
- customers pay only for what they use (if they stop using resources, they stop paying)

# Cloud vs. traditional architecture

The trend toward cloud computing started with a **first wave** known as **colocation**.  
Colocation gave users the financial efficiency of renting physical space, instead of investing in data center real estate.  

**Virtualized data centers** of today, which is the **second wave**, share similarities with the private data centers and colocation  
facilities of decades past.  

The components of virtualized data centers match the physical building blocks of **hosted computing**: servers, CPUs, disks, load  
balancers, and so on. But now they're virtual devices.  

With virtualization, enterprises still maintained the infrastructure; it's still a user-controlled and user-configured environment.  
Several years ago, Google realized that its business couldn't move fast enough within the confines of the virtualization model.  

So Google switched to a **container-based architecture**: a fully automated, elastic **third-wave** cloud that consists of a combination  
of automated services and scalable data. Services automatically provision and configure the infrastructure used to run applications.  

Today, Google Cloud makes this third-wave cloud available to Google customers.  
Google believes that, in the future, every company will differentiate itself from its competitors through technology.  
Increasingly, that technology will be in the form of software. Great software is based on high-quality data.  
This means that every company is, or will eventually become, a data company.  

The virtual world, which includes Google Cloud's network, is built on physical infrastructure, and all those racks of humming  
servers use huge amounts of energy. Together, all existing data centers use roughly 2% of the world's electricity.

# IaaS, PaaS, and Saas

The move to virtualized data centers introduced customers to 2 new types of offerings: 
- infrastructure as a service
- platform as a service

**IaaS** offerings provide raw compute, storage, and network capabilities, organized virtually into resources that are similar to  
physical data centers.  

**PaaS** offerings bind code to libraries that provide access to the infrastructure applications need. This allows more resources  
to be focused on application logic.  

- In the IaaS model, customers pay for the resources they allocate ahead of time.  
- In the PaaS model, customers pay for the resources they actually use.
